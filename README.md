# Fake News Classification on LIAR Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a **fake news classification system** using the [LIAR dataset](https://aclanthology.org/P17-2067.pdf), a collection of 12.8K short political statements labeled for truthfulness. 

The system is inspired by [previous work](https://github.com/moscatena/Fake-News-Classification?tab=readme-ov-file) on LIAR dataset classification, extending it with metadata integration and a fine-tuned DistilBERT + MLP architecture.
