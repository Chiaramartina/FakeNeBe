# Fake News Classification on LIAR Dataset with DistilBERT

## Overview
This project implements a **fake news classification system** using the [LIAR dataset](https://aclanthology.org/P17-2067.pdf), a collection of 12.8K short political statements labeled for truthfulness. 

The system is inspired by [previous work](https://github.com/moscatena/Fake-News-Classification?tab=readme-ov-file) on LIAR dataset classification and aims to leverage a fine-tuned DistilBERT + MLP architecture enhanced with metadata integration, for improved results.

## Getting Started
The repository includes the main script in the form of a Jupyter notebook adapted for use with Google Colab. This version is optimized to leverage a GPU for faster training and inference. Before running the notebook, make sure to set up the required dependencies and configure any necessary paths for your environment.
