# Fake News Classification on LIAR Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a **fake news classification system** using the [LIAR dataset](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~wwang5/liar_dataset.html), a collection of 12.8K short political statements labeled for truthfulness. 
The system is inspired by the by [previous work] (https://github.com/moscatena/Fake-News-Classification/tree/main) on LIAR dataset classification, extending it with metadata integration and a fine-tuned DistilBERT + MLP architecture.
